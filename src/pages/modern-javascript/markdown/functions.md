JavaScript functions are unlike functions in traditional programming languages like Java. Functions can be passed around as variables, and also be provided as arguments to other functions.

JavaScript has two primary ways of creating functions: **function declarations** and **arrow-functions**

## Function Declaration

This type of function has been in the JavaScript language for a while and is the simplest of the two to understand: You declare a function with a name—in this case greet. That function takes in how ever many arguments you want to pass to it—in this case one argument called name. Inside the braces you can perform whatever business logic you’d like, and whatever you return is what you will get back when the function is called.

## Arrow Function

Arrow functions were introduced into the JavaScript language in 2015 and aim to simplify function creation. They come with a slight learning curve and have a bit of nuance to them, but are quite powerful and greatly improve readability of code.
