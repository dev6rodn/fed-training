# Overview

In this learning path, you'll gain exposure to new methods and syntax. Additionally, you'll follow examples on how to use them.

This guide includes an interactive environment where you'll be given plenty of opportunites to experiment.

Along the way, the goal is to break down false assumptions, and enforce good practice.

To start, here are a few items that you should know:

- ☕️ Javascript !== Java
- 👹 Javascript is not **weird** or **broken**, it's just _different_
- 🙅🏾‍♂️ Javascript is not the DOM (we'll talk more about the DOM later on)
- 👶🏽 Javascript has evolved and continues to evolve (ES6? How about ES9!)
- ♜ Javascript is simple to get started with, as with many things, mastery takes time.
