The problem with <code>var</code> is that it doesn't always respect curly braces when and so scoping can be hard to determine. However, when using <code>const</code> or <code>let</code> they respect all curly braces.  The difference between <code>let</code> and <code>const</code> is that <code>let</code> allows for reassignment, while <code>const</code> does not.</blockquote>
