With a high level overview out of the way, we are now in a position to discuss individual concepts.  In later sections we'll take these concepts and apply them together in an application.

We've see the image above before.  It's the same from the _overview_ section. Recall the associated note:

#### üìù An action is triggered from the UI, and flows into the reducers, the reducers return a new piece of state which gets put into the store. The store feeds data back into the UI.

Let's begin to dissect this. For our purposes, we know that the _Web App_ will be a React application.  However, we have not discussed what an action is, what it does, or how we write them.

### Our First Action

An action is an object with a `type` property. That's it. Now as with any object, we can add more data to it. However, at its core, the requirements for a redux object is simply an object with a `type` property, in which the `type` property has a string value.

```js
const toggleModal = {
  type: "TOGGLE_MODAL"
}
```

As you'll come to realize, most of the time spent writing redux logic will be spent writing normal JavaScript.
