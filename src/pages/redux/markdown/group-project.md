<h1 style="text-align: center; text-decoration: underline; margin-top: 50px">Group Project: Deleting Todos</h1>

In the last section, we were able to add items to our todo list, however we weren't able to delete any. In this challenge section, your task is to change that by adding in a delete feature.

In preparing for this feature addition, another developer refactored the structure of our code, however we notice that todos are not longer able to be added. So we'll have to fix that bug before we can get started with adding our feature.

### Tasks to Complete

1. **fix**: display todos when a user adds them in the input
1. **feat**: add ability to delete individual todos when clicked
