<h1 style="text-align: center; text-decoration: underline">ðŸš¨Module Challenge: React Gif LoaderðŸš¨</h1>

<h3 style="font-style: bold; text-align:center;">estimated time to completion: 1 hour</h3>

This section will take all the topics covered in the previous sections and put them to the test. This module challenge is meant to serve as a practical exercise that simulates what it's like to work in a real-world environment.

## Project Overview

This challenge picks up at the end of the Gif Loader section. If needing to catch up, you can grab those files [in the solution directory](/learning-tracks/react/gif-loader-functional)

âœ¨Let's pretend our Gif Loader application turned out to be a huge successâœ¨

Now that we've gotten some more funding from our investors, we can implement 2 new features that our customers are asking us:

1. Displaying multiple gifs
1. Letting them choose how many gifs to display

**You're challenge is to get this working.**

## Project Insight

Review the ["search" docs on Giphy](https://developers.giphy.com/docs/) to verify how we can control how many gifs get returned. Create a UI element to take in that information from the user.

When it comes to rendering lists of content, React again relies on JavaScript to do it's iterating, however it does have convention over which JavaScript methods can be used and how. [Consult the React docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/lists-and-keys.html) and try your best to get this going. Feel free to consult a partner if needing help.

This challenge is two-fold:

1. Using what we've learned to solve a solution
2. Getting familiar with the documentation to figure out what we didn't cover
