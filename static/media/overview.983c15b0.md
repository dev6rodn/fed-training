As such, the very first question we must answer is, "Where do we start?"

In the first triangle, there items HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are simply noted as the tools needed for frontend development. In this image, not enough context is given to determine where to begin.

In the pyramid image, they are ordered with HTML being the foundation, CSS being the next item, and JavaScript being on top. While this gives us context on where to start, a pyramid implies importance, and modern applications have a higher dependency on JavaScript than what is portrayed.

The last section simply has a line to notate the path, but doesn't detail the importance. This is the course that we'll be taking.

The frontend landscape is vast and evergrowing. Instead of being told what the importance is of each section, we'll go through and identify key parts that are relevant to the types of applications we'll be building.

Let's begin with HTML!
