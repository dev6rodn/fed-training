# Our Very First Site

To help get us warmed up and ready for more complex applications, we'll create a blog and deploy the site so that we can note our progress throughout training!

Since we are actively learning, we'll keep the scope functional and worry about adding a bunch of bells and whistles later on 😅

📝It's worth mentioning that in this training course, we'll typically have one of four different types of projects:

1. **Follow the leader**: You'll type what I type
2. **Fend for yourself**: I'll monitor the class as a whole while everyone works alone to solve a challenge.
3. **Pair Programming**: You'll pair to solve a challenge
4. 🔥**Mob Programming**🔥: The class works together...but with a twist 😈

## Getting started

To get comfortable working in CodeSandbox, we'll start by selecting the blue "Open in Editor" button on the right-hand side. This will take us to CodeSandbox, which if you're not already, will prompt you to sign in.

Because we're starting from a template (a basic one at that), we'll press ctrl + s to save (cmd + s on a mac). Doing so will fork the repo. 

We're now ready to explore some features of CodeSandbox and begin development

## Project Goals

The goals for this project are as follows:

* Create a blog that contains the following:
  * Header
  * Footer
  * A list of posts
* Selecting a post link navigates the user to the relevant post
* The site is in version control on GitHub
* The site is deployed to the web

## Project Requirements

Below are more technical items that outline the approach taken

* Semantic HTML elements must be used when possible
* Effective use of classes, and id's must be used when necessary.
* Folder structure must allow developers to logically add more posts
* The site must contain CSS, images, and links to show personality

## 🚨Project Challenges🚨

1. Add a new post with an image--don't forget to add the footer and navigation as well.
2. Add an "About" link to the navigation and have it link to a new About page that gives a small summary about who you are.
3. Remove the underline from the posts on the homepage, but keep it for all other links.
4. Center the text displayed in the header on the homepage
5. Change the color of the text in the header to something besides black.
